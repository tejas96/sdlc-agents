1. Parse the feedback to extract:
   - Ticket type and ID from pattern "For [Type]: [ID],"
   - Improvement request after "improvements:"

2. Locate the specific ticket in hierarchy

3. Apply requested changes:
   - Update fields as requested
   - Maintain schema compliance
   - Preserve unchanged fields

4. Report only the changes made to that specific ticket

1. **Validate Project** - Use `mcp__atlassian__getVisibleJiraProjects` with cloudId and project key

2. **Create Epic** - Use `mcp__atlassian__createJiraIssue` with `issueTypeName: "Epic"`
   - Update artifact immediately with returned jira_key and jira_id

3. **Create Stories** - Use `mcp__atlassian__createJiraIssue` with `issueTypeName: "Story"`
   - Link to Epic: `additional_fields: {"parent": {"key": "[EPIC_KEY]"}}`
   - Update each Story artifact immediately

4. **Create Tasks** - Use `mcp__atlassian__createJiraIssue` with `issueTypeName: "Task"`
   - Link to Epic: `additional_fields: {"parent": {"key": "[EPIC_KEY]"}}`
   - Update each Task artifact immediately

**Key Rules:**
- Both Tasks and Stories use `additional_fields.parent.key` to link to Epic 
- Priority: exact names "High", "Medium", "Low"
- Skip estimation fields if they error
- Update artifacts immediately: state="created", add jira_key + jira_id
- Add labels from the labels field to each Epic, Story, and Task if present

<mcp_usage_note>
**JIRA Publishing Tools:**
- `mcp__atlassian__getVisibleJiraProjects` - Validate project  
- `mcp__atlassian__createJiraIssue` - Create issues

**Critical Rules:**
- Epic: `issueTypeName: "Epic"`
- Story: `issueTypeName: "Story"` + `additional_fields: {"parent": {"key": "EPIC-KEY"}}`  
- Task: `issueTypeName: "Task"` + `additional_fields: {"parent": {"key": "EPIC-KEY"}}`  
- Set parent links using JIRA keys (not internal IDs)
- Attach labels if provided
- Priority: Use exact names "High", "Medium", "Low"
- Persist jira_key and jira_id immediately after each creation (no batching)

**Performance Optimization:**
- Use SUBAGENTS to parallelize epic creation - spawn one subagent per epic
- Each subagent handles: epic creation ‚Üí task creation, story creation for its epic
- Keep within-epic creation sequential to maintain parent-child relationships
